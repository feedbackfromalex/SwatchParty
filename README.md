### About the swatches

All the swatches included in this project were made on Col-o-ring swatch cards, with the exception of the following, which were made on Bee Super Deluxe mixed media paper:

* [Bobtail Squid Green](SearchSwatches/133.png)
* [Golden Gate Bridge](SearchSwatches/55.png)
* [Green Tea](SearchSwatches/132.png)
* [San Francisco Bay](SearchSwatches/167.png)
* [Viceroy Butterfly Orange](SearchSwatches/64.png)

I used dip pens (Sailor Hocoro and Kakimori with a stainless steel nib) and painbrushes (Dynasty Black Silver and some random plastic brushes from Flax) to create the swatches. I scanned the images on a flatbed scanner.

The samples were collected from Van Ness; Pen Chalet; Goulet Pens; the freebie shelf at Pen Boutique in Columbia, Maryland; and various pen friends.
